Ultima VII Party Planner
========================

This is a project designed to take some of the pain out of training party members in Ultima VII: The
Black Gate. For what it does, this is a complete overkill. The intention of this project was a 
learning exercise (primarily backbone.js). What I thought was going to be a simple little program
turned out to be complicated--for me anyway.

There is a very small niche community of about five people that might find this interesting but not
terribly useful.

Still some work to do, when it's done the project will be online.
